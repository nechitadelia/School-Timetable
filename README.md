# SchoolPlanner

School Planner app is a website designed for secondary schools. 
It is meant to simplify the process of managing the classes and professors of the school, by giving the possibility to associate professors to all existing classes in just a few clicks.

School Planner is thus a dynamic full-stack website, hosted on Azure. The back-end site is made with ASP.NET Core MVC, while the front-end is made with JavaScript.
