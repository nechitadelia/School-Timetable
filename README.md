# SchoolPlanner

School Planner app is a website designed for secondary schools.
It allows users to configure their own classes, professors and subjects. More than that, the app simplifies the process of associating professors to all classes in just a few clicks.

The website is thus a dynamic full-stack website made to perform CRUD operations on a database, and it is hosted on Azure. The back-end site is made with ASP.NET Core MVC, while the front-end is made with JavaScript.
